# Video infographics are here!

We're extremely excited to announce the beta release of video infographics in Sprites! With this feature you can take your entire infographic and export it to a video file. As an option you can specify an audio file of your choice which is great for adding background music or narration to your infographics.

If you'd like to participate in a beta program, go to [spritesapp.com/video]https://spritesapp.com/video, click "Contact us", fill out the form (don't forget to specify your email so we can contact you back) and we will be in touch shortly with all the details you need to get started!

Once video export is enabled for your subscription plan, you'll see a new option - "Create video" - under the "Publish" menu item:

![Create video](/assets/img/posts/video-export-dialog.png "Create video")

You can choose the format of your video file (read, quality) as well as an audio track to be mixed with the video. Sprites also tells you how long your infographic is going to be playing (the value is approximate although it’s very close to the actual one). When you’re ready, click "Download video" and be patient while we’re exporting your infographic. The time it will take to complete an export is greater than or equal to the length of the video so in the example above, I’d have to wait for at least 1 minute before Sprites offers me the video file. Don’t worry – you’ll be able to track the progress (there will be a countdown timer). Once the export completes, the browser will ask you to save the video file on your disk.

Let's take a look at the example. Here's a quick infographic about Stanford University:
