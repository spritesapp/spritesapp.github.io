# Introducing theme customizer

Today we're excited to share great news with you: we've just released a feature update that allows you to effortlessly create amazing personalized design themes in Sprites. Let's quickly go through the new functionality to see it in action.

First, we've changed the way themes are laid out in the "Infographic settings" modal window. Now the drop-down list looks like this:

![Infographic settings](/assets/img/posts/create-theme-presentation-settings.png "Infographic settings")

There's still a way for you to completely customize the given theme if you're familiar with [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) but it's now also possible to create a new one right in Sprites. This is done by selecting "Make your own" in the drop-down list.

Once the selection is made, a new modal window appears:

![Create theme step 1](/assets/img/posts/create-theme-step-1.png "Create theme step 1")

Under the first step of this simple 3-step wizard you're prompted to pick an existing theme that you wish to customize (this can be one of the standard themes or even your own theme that you've uploaded earlier). When the selection is made, click "Next" to move to the next step.

Under the second step you're able customize previously selected theme by changing things like font family and color, accent colors, background color and image. You can now also specify a business logo that will be automatically displayed on every slide (something many of our users have been asking for).

There's a huge collection of various free fonts available to you via our Google Fonts integration. Start typing inside a text box to search for a particular font:

![Create theme step 2 fonts](/assets/img/posts/create-theme-step-2-fonts.png "Create theme step 2 fonts")

You can also place your mouse pointer over the little "Text" icon on the right of each font to see how it looks like:

![Create theme step 2 font preview](/assets/img/posts/create-theme-step-2-font-preview.png "Create theme step 2 font preview")

Similar "Preview" overlay is available for image fields (background image and business logo):

![Create theme step 2 image preview](/assets/img/posts/create-theme-step-2-image-preview.png "Create theme step 2 image preview")

Once you're satisfied with your customization, click "Next" to go to the last step.

Under the third (and the last) step you can pick a new name for your theme:

![Create theme step 3](/assets/img/posts/create-theme-step-3.png "Create theme step 3")

When you're done, click "Create theme" to generate a theme file that will be put into Sprites (the newly created theme will only be visible to you). After the theme is created, you'll be redirected back to the "Infographic settings" modal with your new theme pre-selected.

Here's a quick example of how you can take a standard Sprites theme and make something extremely pink out of it:

![Hello Kitty](/assets/img/posts/create-theme-slide-example.png "Hello Kitty")
