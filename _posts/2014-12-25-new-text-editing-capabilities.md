# New text editing capabilities

Although, it's officially a holiday season, we're as always busy addressing your wishes and improving Sprites. Today's little addition - new text editing capabilies.

When editing the contents of a "Text" element, you can now click on a little "triple dot" icon on the toolbar and get additional text formatting options which include:

1. Text justification (left, right, center, justify).
2. Creation of ordered and unordered lists.
3. Subscript and superscript formatting.

Here's a screenshot of a new toolbar:

The same functionality is available when editing the contents of a callout or when editing tables.

Also, for the "Text" element you can now specify the maximum allowed width of a text block by using the slider:

That's all for now! As usual, like us on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/spritesapp) or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/spritesapp) to get product updates, hints and tips on creating great-looking visual content!

Have a great holidays!

Sprites team.
