# Latest editor improvements

Although we're working hard on getting [video infographics](https://spritesapp.com/video) out of the beta, we still spend quite alot of time improving the overal experience and satisfying your wishes :-) Let's take a look at what has been added to Sprites during the last week.

### Locking elements in a given position

You can now lock an element in its current position so that you don't accidentally move it. In order to lock an element, click on a "lock" icon which is now available within the element's context menu:

### Displaying element's current coordinates when moving

Sometime you want to get really precise when moving elements around. Now you can actually see element's current position (X/Y coordinates) when you are dragging it with your mouse:

### Selecting multiple elements

This one is a long-awaited feature! You can now select multiple elements with your mouse the same way you select icons on your desktop. When multiple elements are selected, you can move them around as a whole or you can delete them altogether:

### More precise font size selection

When editing text, it's sometimes hard to match the font size among multiple blocks using the "Font size" slider. As part of the latest update you can see what's the current font size being selected for a given text:

### Various sizes for Events element

The Events element gained an improvement: you can now specify its relative size using the radio buttons:

And that's all for now!
