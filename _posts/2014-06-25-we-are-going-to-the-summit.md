# We are going to The Summit!

It's with great pleasure I'd like to announce that Sprites was selected for [Alpha, the early stage startup track](http://summitdublin.com/startups/alpha) at [The Summit](http://summitdublin.com) (one of the largest and most amazing tech conferences in Europe). This means that we're going to Dublin this November!

What does this mean for us? It means that we're doing the right thing (and, by the way, thank you ALL for your feedback and support!). We're extremely thankful for this kind of recognition and for the opportunity we've got.

What do we expect from The Summit? To listen to many inspiring speakers, to grasp some of their knowledge, to meet a lot of great people and, of course, to present Sprites and get some valuable feedback on the product, direction and vision.

Hope to see many of you at The Summit!

Sprites team.
