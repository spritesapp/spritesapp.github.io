# Sprites turns one!

Time flies! This week Sprites has officially turned one year. It's been an amazing journey and I'm looking forward to the next year, full of new discoveries, brilliant thoughts and unforgettable moments.

This week we are also celebrating a **20,000** sign-up mark! Thank you for being with us, folks. You're awesome!

## Quick numbers

To quickly recap on this year's progress so far, things are looking very good and we are seeing a positive trend in our userbase growth (we expect to hit a 25,000 figure by end of year):

As for what we've been occupied with lately, this little chart pretty much says it all:

</a>

As you may have noticed, we've been pretty quiet on Facebook and Twitter lately. That's because we've decieded to put extra effor in fixing what's currently broken and making Sprites a little bit more useful.

## What's next

We have a lot planned, some of what we expect to realise by end of this year. To summarize it all in one sentence: we want to make Sprites a truly valuable tool which will give a new meaning and help you visualize and present the information you work with daily.

Cheers,

Pavel Volgarev (founder, Sprites).
