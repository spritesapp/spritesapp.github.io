# Social sharing, preview mode and other new features.

It's a very busy time at Sprites these days - so many great new features are being added and we can't wait to share the details with you.

First of all, we've added an ability to share infographics on your social networks of choice directly from the editor (available under "Publish" menu item):

![Social sharing](/assets/img/posts/social-sharing.png "Social sharing")

Next, you can now copy any element and then paste it on the same or a different slide. To copy an element use either the "Document" icon under the element context menu or Ctrl+C (Cmd+C on Mac) shortcut when the element is selected. Once the element is copied, the corresponding notification is displayed in the left main menu (to paste an element simply click on an icon):

![Paste element](/assets/img/posts/paste-element.png "Paste element")

It's now become super-easy to preview your work using a "Preview infographic" link located at the top right corner of the screen (next to the user menu):

![Preview infographic](/assets/img/posts/preview-infographic.png "Preview infographic")

Another great little feature that we've implemented allows you to reorder slides by using the drag-and-drop method (the new order is saved automatically):

![Reoder slides](/assets/img/posts/reorder-slides.png "Reoder slides")

Finally, the "Image" element has been substantially improved. Along with the support for [SVG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), it's now possible to select a simple image from the gallery rather than uploading it youself. This mode supports selecting image color as well:

![Image gallery](/assets/img/posts/image-gallery.png "Image gallery")

That was all for now, we hope you liked the new stuff! 

Cheers!

Sprites team.
