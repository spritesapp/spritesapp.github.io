# Rich text editing in tables

We've noticed that some folks would wish that our "Table" element was a bit more flexible: for example, by allowing the user to insert an image into the table cell. We're happy to tell you that we've made some changes to the way you edit your table data so it's now possible to use rich text formatting capabilities (bold/italic/underline text, custom color and text size, etc.) within each table cell.

Here's the screenshot demonstrating the new functionality:

Also, for those who'd like to stick to the "plain text" mode there's a switch at the bottom left corner which allows you to turn off rich text formatting.

Enjoy!
