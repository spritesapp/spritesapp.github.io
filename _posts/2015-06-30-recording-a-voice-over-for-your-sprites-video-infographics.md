# Recording a voice-over for your Sprites video infographics

It's been quite a while since we've posted here last time (2 months to be precise!). Although we've been busy addressing your feedback and making sure you guys are happy with the product, we didn't stop innovating and brigning in new cool features. Today we'd like to briefly tell you about one of those: we've just added an ability for you to record a voice-over for your video infographics in Sprites!

Let's take a look at how to perform this voice-over recording. The new option is available in "Publish" menu, under "Create video" tab:

![Record voice-over link](/assets/img/posts/voice-over-link.png "Record voice-over link")

When clicked, a new modal dialog shows up and you'll see your infographic in there when recording your voice. At any given point of time you can either stop the recording and save it, or, if you made a mistake and need to repeat everyting, there's a little "Restart" button on the toolbar:

In case you've also specified an audio file for your video, it will be mixed together with your voice (the volume will be automatically adjusted so that the audio plays in a backgound and your voice is clear and loud enough).


We hope you'll enjoy this new feature. As usual, like us on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/spritesapp) or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/spritesapp) to get product updates, hints and tips on creating amazing infographics and online presentations!
