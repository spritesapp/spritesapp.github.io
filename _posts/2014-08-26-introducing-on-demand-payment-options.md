# Introducing On Demand payment options

For those who only uses Sprites occasionally but needs access to all of its great features (additional building blocks, image export, password protection, [etc.](https://spritesapp.com/pricing)) we've introduced a new On Demand payment options. 

With On Demand usage enabled, you get the full-featured "Pro" plan for the full seven days with much lower (comparing to three month normal plan) one-time payment. In order to enable On Demand usage, navigate to [your account](https://spritesapp.com/account) page and select "On Demand usage" option:

Make sure to select "Pro" plan first, though ("Free" plan is free, forever and ever).

We hope that the new payment options will make it much easier for some to take full advantage of using Sprites without long term commitments.

Cheers!

Sprites team.
