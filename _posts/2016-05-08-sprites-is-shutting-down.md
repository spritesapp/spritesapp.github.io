# Sprites is shutting down

It is with heavy heart I'm announcing today that Sprites is shutting down. The service will go offline on **August 1st, 2016** and all user data will be deleted from the servers on the same day.

Effective immediately we will not be accepting new sign-ups for our "Pro" and "Ultimate" plans and no new payments will be accepted either. If you need your paid service to be prolonged, please reach out to Pavel at pavel.volgarev@spritesapp.com (please include the email you've used to sign-up).

Existing paid uses will be able to export their infographics into images, PDFs or videos using the standard functionality. If you're a free subscriber and wish to export your data, please reach out to Pavel at pavel.volgarev@spritesapp.com (please include the email you've used to sign-up). 

Users who are seeking for a replacement service, are recommended to try the following great alternatives: [Infogr.am](https://infogr.am/), [Piktochart](https://piktochart.com/) or [Canva](https://www.canva.com/create/infographics/).

It was an amazing journey. Thank you for being part of it.

Pavel Volgarev (founder, Sprites).
