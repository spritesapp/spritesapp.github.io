# Introducing slide templates

Hi guys!

Today marks the beginning of [Web Summit](http://websummit.net/) where our [Tim Voronov](https://twitter.com/ziflex) is sharing our passion for elegant and beautiful visual stories with some of the conference attendees (if you're over there, make sure to stop by the stand **SCL125** to say "Hi").

Today we're also announcing a new handy feature - slide templates. It allows you to get started with Sprites even quicker by letting it generate some visuals (which you can customize, of course) for you when you're adding a new slide.

Here's how the "New slide" dialog now looks like:

![New slide](/assets/img/posts/slide-template-new.png "New slide")

As you can see, there's now a new field called "Template" which allows you to pick from the current set of eight template. Once selected, you can immediately test the results and then customize them later during the process:

![Template result](/assets/img/posts/slide-template-result.png "Template result")

That's about it! As usual, like us on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/spritesapp) or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/spritesapp) to get product updates, hints and tips on creating great-looking visual content!

Cheers!

Sprites team.
