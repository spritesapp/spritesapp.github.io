# Presenter mode: Presenting your visual stories with ease

Presenting your Sprites infographics in front of a live audience just got so much better and easier! Let's take a look at the brand new "Presenter" mode.

When you bring up the "Publish" dialog, you will notice that there's now a new tab called "Present":

Here you can configure how your infographic looks and behaves when your intent is to present it on a large screen. For example, you may want to tweak default animations (by either minimizing them or turning them off completely). You can also tell Sprites to remind you to go fullscreen when infographic is about to be shown (you can always manually enter or exit fullscreen mode by pressing F11 key on your keyboard).

When you're ready to present, hover over the "View & present" menu item at the top bar in the Editor and choose "Present":

A tip: You can load any Sprites infographic in a "Presenter" mode by appending **?presenter=1** to the URL.

That's all for now, happy presenting!

Sprites team.
