# Introducing real-time collaboration in Sprites

Dear friends,

We are super-excited to announce a new set of major features that we are making available as of today. These features are for teams and what they allow you to do is to collaborate on your Sprites infographics **in real time**!

Let's take a look at how to use the new functionality. Live collaboration in Sprites is based on the concept of sharing your infographic with other people. And in this case "sharing" means giving them "collaborator" access so that they could edit a specific infographic even if they didn't create it originally. To share an infographic, click on your name in the top right corner of the [editor](https://spritesapp.com/edit). You will notice that the menu has been substantially improved:

You now get two separate lists. First one (the top one) contains your own infographics and the second one (the bottom one) contains infographics that are currently shared with you. To share an infographic you need to invite collaborators which is done by clicking on "Edit" link under the "Collaborators" column. This brings up the following modal dialog:

You can add collaborators by typing their email addresses into the text box and clicking on "Add" button. When you're done, click "Save" and Sprites will send out email invitations to the people you've specified. If the given person doesn't have a Sprites account, he will be prompted to create one first. Note that all collaborators need to confirm their participation by clicking on a link from the email invitation.

Now, shared infographics behave exactly the same as the ones you've created yourself meaning that, as collaborator, you have nearly full control over them (changing elements, adding/removing slides, changing settings and so on). But the real power comes when you decide to work on your infographic as a team!

When you've opened a shared infographic together with someone else, you'll notice that you now have access to a team chat located at the bottom right corner:

![Team chat](/assets/img/posts/collab-chat.png "Team chat")

The chat allows you to have quick, ad-hoc discussions about the work you're currently performing, without even leaving Sprites.

When you're multiple people editing the same infographic simultaneously, you'll see each other's updates in real time:

This instant feedback is not limited to just elements of your infographic but also applies to slides:

We hope you'll love the new capabilities (all of which are available to our [Ultimate](https://spritesapp.com/pricing) plan members)! As we mentioned, we're extremely excited and proud of what we've achieved for all of you guys!
