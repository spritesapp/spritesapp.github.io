# Strong teams move faster

Dear friends,

We are continuing this year with some really exciting news: Sprites is happy to welcome our new family member - **Daniela Alvarez** (Denny). 

Denny is joining Sprites as our own Chief Marketing Officer and a head of Business Development. With a keen eye for marketing and all things visual, she became the perfect candidate to bring Sprites, as a company, to new heights.

A globe trotter who was born in USA, raised in Mexico, crazed-up in China and educated in Canada, Denny brings new ideas with focus and decision. An art and design enthusiast herself who decided to follow her true passion and pursue Business and Marketing after switching from an International Relations degree. This overly-chatty person is always here to help you so donâ€™t hesitate to contact her anytime at [daniela.alvarez@spritesapp.com](mailto:daniela.alvarez@spritesapp.com). 

Sprites was created with the motive to enable everyone to create crisp visual content in the simplest and cleanest way. Denny comes in to spread every component of this vision. 

Welcome to the family!
