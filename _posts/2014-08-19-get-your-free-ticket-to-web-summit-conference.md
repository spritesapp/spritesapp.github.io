# Get your free ticket to Web Summit conference!

As you probably [already know](http://blog.spritesapp.com/2014/06/25/we-are-going-to-the-summit.html), we've been honored to be part of this year's Alpha program at the annual [Web Summit](http://websummit.net/) conference which takes place in Dublin from 4th til 6th of November.

As part of the admission package we've received three standard attendee tickets which give you access to the variety of things happening within the three-day event (over 500 talks, workshops, great food, Night Summit party, etc.) Unfortunately, we haven't been able to use the third ticket (Sprites team currently consists of two people - me and [Timofey](https://twitter.com/ziflex)) so we've decided **to give away the last ticket for free**.

If you'd like to have the ticket, [send us a message](mailto:volpav+spritesapp@gmail.com?subject=Web+Summit+ticket) explaining why would you like to go and what is it in this great event for you (also, before contacting us, please make sure you will be able to make it to the event). And of course, feel free to share link to this post with your network!

The lucky individual will be announced in a separate blog post in mid. October.

Cheers!

Sprites team.
