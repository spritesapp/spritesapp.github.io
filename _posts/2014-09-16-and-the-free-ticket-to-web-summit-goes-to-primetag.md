# And the free ticket to Web Summit goes to... PrimeTag!

It's with great pleasure we'd like to announce that the free ticket to Web Summit (the one the giveaway for which [we announced](http://blog.spritesapp.com/2014/08/19/get-your-free-ticket-to-web-summit-conference.html) last month) goes to Manuel Albuquerque and the PrimeTag team! We've asked Manuel a couple of questions about his product - here's the little Q&A:

###*Manuel, what is PrimeTag? Give us your elevator pitch!*

PrimeTag is a technology that uses an advanced algorithm to identify products or suggest similar and most profitable ones in digital contents. 

###*How did you come up with an idea for PrimeTag?*

I am a surf fanatic and most of my close friends are sponsored by major surf brands. One thing I realized was that they used constantly photos and vids from their amazing trips to not only promote their skills but also their sponsoring brands. It's funny! There was no product's link between the photo/vid and the e-store of the brand, thus missing an opportunity right away to generate a sale. At that time I understood it was a big opportunity to tackle. In one hand to create brand's awareness and increase sales and in the other hand to give my close friends a revenue stream. After partnering with Paulo Gaspar, this idea evolved to something that can really change the perception of online advertising. 

###*What's so unique about the product?*

We use an effective product placement tool, thus shortening the path between instant interest on a product and its access to purchase. If we look closely to nowadays advertising solutions, they are still far from the most interesting point of purchase - I mean far from digital contents. Users engage with products when seen in pictures and videos and that's the point and moment we want to give them the opportunity to know more about them - thus increasing conversion rates. Lastly, we have in place an exquisite team of senior engineers that are willing to push the limits of technology and create the most advanced algorithm on product detection in digital contents. 

###*Tell us an interesting fact about PrimeTag?*

When the idea arrived my biggest challenge was to find the right development team for the project. I really thought it was mission impossible VII, given the challenges faced. I called my partner, former CTO from our first startup, and funny fact - he and his coworker were finishing their PhD thesis exactly on the fields necessary for implementation. Together they have +10 years of experience exactly on what is needed to make this project a success.

###*Thanks Manuel! See you in Dublin!*

(End of the Q&A)

We'd also like to say a huge "Thank you!" to all those amazing people who has shown their interest and told us their stories. A special "Thanks" goes to Michael Reen and the Bleepr team for their great story about the trip across Europe they're organizing to promote their app. Hope to see you in Dublin, Michael! 

Take care everybody!

Sprites team.
