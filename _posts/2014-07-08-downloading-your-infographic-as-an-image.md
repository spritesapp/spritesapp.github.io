# Downloading your infographic as an image

The new cool feature is now available in Sprites - an ability to download invividual slides of your infographic as images! The functionality is accessible via "Publish" menu item:

![Image export dialog](/assets/img/posts/image-export-dialog.png "Image export dialog")

So, as you can see we now have two tabs at the top of the dialog window. The "Share link" tab contains all the settings you used to tweak when sharing your infographic on the web. On the other hand, under "Download as image" tab you can specify which slide (and in what resolution) of your infographic you'd like to download as an image file.

Here's an example of what you get:

![Image export result](/assets/img/posts/image-export-result.jpg "Image export result")

Enjoy!

*P.S. Guess what you'll be able to turn your Sprites infographics into after the images (spoiler: we already have this feature working internally)? ;-)*
