# Adding rich content using widgets.

We've noticed that people got very curious about one particular building block in Sprites - "Widget". This is, indeed, the most powerful element which allows you to write arbitrary JavaScript and have it executed when the current slide is being presented to the user. With widgets, you can embed custom graphics (for example, Google Visualizations), display videos (YouTube/Vimeo), show social activity (Twitter cards), load live data and much more.

We've put a set of examples for you demonstrating some of the use case: [The power of widgets](https://spritesapp.com/view/embed/3332).

Make sure to check out the docs as well to see how all the above was implemented: [Adding rich content using widgets](https://github.com/spritesapp/sprites-sdk/wiki/Adding-rich-content-using-widgets).

Cheers!

Sprites team.
