# Import images from Dropbox, Google Drive and Flickr

Dear friends,

Last week we've been spending some time improving our "Image" element in order to give you more freedom and flexibility in bringing your images into Sprites. We're excited to share some amazing results with you. Introducing a brand new **media manager**!

First, we have slightly changed the settings page of an "Image" element: when choosing "URL" as image source, you can now see a little "folder" icon next to image URL field:

![Media picker](/assets/img/posts/media-picker.png "Media picker")

Clicking on the "folder" icon brings up the media manager modal window:

![Media manager](/assets/img/posts/media-dialog.png "Media manager")

Here you can choose image files from various sources. On the screenshot above you can see the files that I've uploaded earlier so it's now super-easy to reuse images that you've already used elsewhere in Sprites (not necessarily on a given infographic). Just to remind you, Sprites supports the following image formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, BMP and SVG.

You can also choose and image from your Google Drive or Dropbox folder by clicking on "Select from..." drop-down menu:

![Media from external source](/assets/img/posts/media-selectfrom.png "Media from external source")

And last, but not least, you can now browse through public Flickr images by flipping the search filter from "Library" to "Flickr":

![Search Flickr](/assets/img/posts/media-flickr.png "Search Flickr")

As always, if you have any questions/comments/suggestions, don't hesitate to contact us at [contact@spritesapp.com](mailto:contact@spritesapp.com) (or by using the [contact form](https://spritesapp.com/contact) on our website).

Take care!
