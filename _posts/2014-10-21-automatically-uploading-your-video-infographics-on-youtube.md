# Automatically uploading your video-infographics on YouTube

Hello folks!

We've got a new, very handy feature for you today: when exporting your Sprites infographic to a video, you can now enable "Send to YouTube" option which will automatically upload your infographic on YouTube once the export is finished! This makes it so much easier to share and spread great visual stories - definitely a huge win!

Here's now the "Publish" dialog now looks like when you choose "Create video" option:

![YouTube publish](/assets/img/posts/youtube-upload.png "YouTube publish")

Clicking "Enabled" next to "Send to YouTube" will bring up a new window where you'll be asked to kindly give Sprites permission for uploading videos on your behalf. Note that your video will be in "unlisted" state in case you'd like to edit its title, description or tags before making it available to the public.

We hope you'll love the new functionality. As usual, like us on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/spritesapp) or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/spritesapp) to get product updates, hints and tips on creating great-looking visual content!

Cheers!

Sprites team.
