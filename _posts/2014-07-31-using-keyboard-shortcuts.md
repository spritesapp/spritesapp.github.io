# Using keyboard shortcuts

We've just introduced a set of keyboard shortcuts that can help you be much more productive when composing Sprites infographics. 

Here's a little help menu (which opens up when clicking on "Keyboard shortcuts" at the bottom right corner of the editor screen):

![Keyboard shortcuts](/assets/img/posts/shortcut-dialog.png "Keyboard shortcuts")

(Mac users: You can use **Cmd** modifier instead of **Ctrl**).

It's especially worth noting "Bring forward" and "Send backward" shortcuts since this is a completely new functionality which allows you to control the *elevation* of a given element relative to other elements with which it currently overlaps. So, for example, if you have a text which is placed behind another element (for example, an image) you can select the text using the "Left" and "Right" arrow shortcuts and then bring it forward using the "Up" arrow. No more re-adding elements just for the sake of rearranging them in a third dimension!

Enjoy!

Sprites team.
